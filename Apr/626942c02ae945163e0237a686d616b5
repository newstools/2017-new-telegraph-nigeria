Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom said his unending political face-off with his predecessor and former governor of the state, Dr. Gabriel Suswam will soon become history. He specifically said he is waiting for the completion of the investigation being carried against him by the Department of State Services (DSS), in whose custody the ex-governor is at the moment. Suswam has been in custody of the DSS for over two months, following the discovery of what the service called ‘incriminating items’ from two exotic cars allegedly belonging to the former governor, which it also confiscated. Ortom recently, at a widely attended stakeholders’ meeting at the new banquet hall of the Government House in Makurdi, disclosed that he had concluded plans to settle his differences with Suswam to bring about meaningful development in the state. Since the governor made that pronouncement, no sign that he made such promise has either been heard made as an indication to genuinely end the political face-off. But speaking to journalists on the matter in Makurdi, the governor said he has not forgotten about the issue but was waiting for the DSS to conclude their investigation before they would finally settle their scores. “Suswam is being detained by DSS and they are doing their investigations, when they finished and come out with their findings, then, we can take off from there,” said Ortom.
