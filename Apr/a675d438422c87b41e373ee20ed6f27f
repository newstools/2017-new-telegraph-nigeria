Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) opted for greenfield development through public private partnership (PPP) in Takwa Bay area of Lagos and other locations. The move is to attract foreign direct investments into the country and to ensure optimal utilisation of the organisation’s facilities with a view to generating greater dividends for the country through the seaports. The authority’s Managing Director, Hadiza Usman, disclosed this when the management of NPA embarked on inspection of its vast facilities at Tarkwa Bay. Also, the managing director promised to rehabilitate the Lagos Light House at Tarkwa Bay in order to prioritise the possibility of deploying Automatic Identification System (AIS) there. Also, the authority’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Elder Nduonofit Effiong, said in a statement, that the managing director had promised to enhance smooth navigation to approaches of Lagos ports by vessels. He noted that the new steps by NPA would create more employment opportunities, thereby reducing inflationary rate. Meanwhile, Usman explained that the step being taken by NPA would stimulate economic growth in the country. The managing director added that the management of NPA would continue to dialogue with stakeholders with a view to resolving further encumbrances on the facility. She said there would be mutual understanding and an enabling environment for businesses to thrive at the location.
