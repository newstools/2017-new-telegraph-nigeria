Former Super Eagles striker, Jonathan Akpoborie, who was left out of the France 1998 World Cup finals despite playing five of the six qualifiers, has revealed the politics behind his exclusion. The former junior international said a cabal in the team agreed that he must not be part of the final squad for the Mundial. Speaking further, Akpoborie said the then Manager, Bora Milutinovic, was instructed not to pick some players while some must make the final list to France. “That was the first time I saw politics affecting good football. I mean it was there from 1985 when I played at the U-17 level, but not as visible as it was in 1998. “I was in great form and what I could have done for that team, would have been very big, because I was ready. I was the highest goal scorer in the European Cup Winners Cup competition that year with VFB Stuttgart. So my confidence was high. “Bora was tele-guided. He was instructed on the people that will make the team. There was even a Nigerian coach that swore to his mother’s grave that I would not make the team to France.” Akpoborie however stressed that with his absence at the World Cup, Nigeria was the loser, not him. The former VfL Wolfsburg of Germany striker also declared that the Dream Team squad that won the Olympic Games football gold medal in 1996 was the most prepared and dedicated team he played with in the national team. “We used to enjoy training under Jo Bonfrere. The competition for places in the team was really healthy, and sentiments- free. But just before the start of the tournament, I took permission to leave. But with a promise to be on the first flight back if someone got injured because I was one of the alternate overaged players with the team,” he said.
