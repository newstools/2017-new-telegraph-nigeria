A 28-year-old suspect, Kele Agbede, yesterday disclosed how the cultists arrested at Idi-Oro, Mushin, Lagos, used to initiate innocent youths into smoking Indian hemp. Agbede said they used juju (charms) which would not allow innocent buyers they wanted to initiate into smoking hemp to resist it. He said: “This charm in my hand (displaying the charm) is what we always use to get customers. When we fling it at any customer, he must buy and smoke the hemp. From there he will start buying Indian hemp.” According to him, by so doing, they have initiated many unsuspecting youths at Mushin and its environs into hemp smoking. The suspect said that the success of their business depended on how many new smokers they got. Agbede was paraded by the Lagos State Police Commissioner, Fatai Owoseni, alongside 58 other suspects arrested in connection with a bloody clash at Mushin. The suspects, according to Owoseni, were arrested at Idi-Oro area of Mushin with bags of Indian hemp, machetes and other dangerous weapons. Owoseni disclosed that police arrested 68 suspects, but nine who did not participate in the clash were set free while 59 others were still undergoing interrogations and would soon be charged to court. He said: “One of our major discoveries is the bags of Indian hemp, machetes, other dangerous weapons and pump action guns. We are after their sponsors who live outside Mushin but use them to foment trouble by fighting for illegal money in the market.”
