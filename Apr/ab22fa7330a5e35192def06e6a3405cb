This month’s edition of Elders’ Forum, jointly organized by O’jez Entertainment Group and Evergreen Musical Company Limited will be celebrating, post-humously, the musical legacy of Dr. Orlando Owoh, popularly called the African Kenery today. Owoh passed on in November 2008. In line with the objectives of the Elders Forum which is recognising and honouring immeasurable contributions to the growth and promotion of heritage Nigerian and African music, at home and in the Diaspora by individuals and organizations; the planning committee members have strategized to relive the memories of this legend with the hosting of delightful performances by one of his most profound successors in the person of his son, Chief Daisi Orlando Owoh. This will afford the teeming fans of the African Kenery Sound an opportunity to savour those nostalgic songs from one of its most prolific ambassadors. The music legend had over 45 albums to his credit. Also to be honoured at the event is the oldest surviving member of the original Dr. Orlando Owoh’s band in the person of Mr. Tosin Akilapa. As usual, a major highlight of this month’s event will be the presentation of a post-humous ‘Lifetime Achievements’ award to the late Orlando Owoh.
