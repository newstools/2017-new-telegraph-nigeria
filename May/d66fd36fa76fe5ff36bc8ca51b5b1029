Workers of the Ogun State Broadcasting Corporation (OGBC) were yesterday poised for a showdown with the state government over their unpaid salaries and allowances. The workers, who have threatened to embark on strike if their demands are not met, accused the station management, led by Engr. Tunde Awolana, of diverting funds meant to offset their demands. To this end, members of the Radio Television and Theatre Art Workers Union (RATTAWU) and Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) at the corporation had issued a seven-day and final ultimatum for the payment of the outstanding salaries and allowances. The decision was taken at a joint congress of both unions held at the stationâ€™s premises in Abeokuta, the state capital. A notice of the ultimatum, addressed to the OGBC General Manager, was signed by RATTAWU and NUJ Chairmen respectively of the station, Ayo Aina and Abiodun Ogundipe, on behalf of the 157 workers. Our correspondent gathered that the workers were spoiling for war over the alleged non-payment of about N148,264,000, said to be their outstanding entitlements between 2012 and 2017. The aggrieved workers, while calling on Governor Ibikunle Amosun to come to their aid, said the ultimatum was given after the expiration of the 14-day ultimatum earlier given to the management.
