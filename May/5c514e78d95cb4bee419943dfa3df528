Kano State workers, under their umbrella union, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) have expressed concern over decision by the National Assembly to initiate and support the ‘unpopular moves’ aimed at removing the minimum wage from the exclusive to concurrent list. They said it was indeed sad that those that supposed to promote issues that would strengthen democracy through popular policies and guarantee peace in the country were doing the contrary. “We will like to state clearly without ambiguity that workers shall resist any attempt from any quarters and by anybody to infringe on their rights,” they insisted. Also, the workers urged the state government to make clear statements on their Paris Club Debt Refund, as well as using the money to pay their over N11 billion entitlements. Speaking at the State Indoor Stadium on Monday, the NLC Chairman in the state, Comrade Kabiru Ado Minjibir, said such clear statement on the Paris Club refund had become necessary for workers to know that the government was strictly following the guidelines for the release of the funds. Minjibir, however, expressed concern that the government would respect the position of the Federal Government on the Paris Club refund by using the substantial amount of the refunded money to offset outstanding gratuity and death benefits to the retired state civil servants. “The outstanding gratuity and death benefits to the retired civil servants in the state has now risen to over N11 billion, which required the quick intervention of the government.” The NLC Chairman said payment of the outstanding entitlements was necessary taking into consideration the present situation of the retired workers and their families who served the state diligently.
