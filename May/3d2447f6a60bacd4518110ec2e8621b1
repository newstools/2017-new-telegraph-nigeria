There was a new twist in the alleged certificate forgery against the Chairman, Senate Committee on Public Accounts, Senator Andy Uba, at the weekend. To this end, a coalition of human rights lawyers had asked for the arrest and prosecution of the private investigator, who raised the alarm, Mr. Victor Osita Uwajeh, accusing him of complicity. Uwajeh had last week accused the senator of forging his certificates, explaining that he had access to some of the forged certificates. However, the lawyers who addressed journalists in Enugu at the weekend, asked the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris, to commence without further delay, investigation on the petition written by Uba against Uwajeh. They said an immediate investigation of the petition had become necessary, following their belief that Uwajeh’s admission of having somebody’s forged certificate makes him guilty and this was enough to possibly prosecute and convict him. Leader of the group, Mr. Anayo Adibe of Anayo Adibe and Partners, said the only way to ascertain the truth about the allegation was for the arrest and prosecution of Uwajeh, explaining that doing this had also become necessary as he (Uwajeh) had sometimes been acquitted by the court against fraudulent charges.
