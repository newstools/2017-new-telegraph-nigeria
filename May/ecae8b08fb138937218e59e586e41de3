An Ogun State High Court sitting at Ipokia will on May 11 deliver ruling on the objection filed by the state government in the tussle over the traditional stool of Onihunbo of Ihunbo town in Ipokia Local Government Area. The presiding judge, Justice S. M. Owodunni, fixed the date for ruling following “the administrative lapses” on the part of the court clerk. The court had adjourned ruling last week on the notice of preliminary objection filed by the state Ministry of Justice to the suit challenging the installation of Oba Olamide Joseph as the new Onihunbo. The Agbotejoye Ruling House had approached the state High Court, Ipokia Judicial Division, to contest the appointment of Oba Joseph of the Inakankan Ruling House. The claimants contended that the monarch, who was installed on March 18, was illegally enthroned as it was not yet the turn of his ruling house. They averred that after the demise of the immediate past traditional ruler, Oba Jacob Solagbade of Osupa Ruling House in March 2014 after reigning for 24 years, it was the turn of Agbotejoye Ruling House to produce the next monarch. In the suit, the claimants also joined the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Ipokia Local Government, three kingmakers and members of the Inakankan Ruling House
