As the country was yet to recover from the scourge of Meningitis that hit some parts of northern Nigeria, killing almost 800 people, Nasarawa State was yesterday said to be hit by Bird Flu otherwise called Avian Influenza that had reportedly killed unspecified number of chickens. Investigations reported cases of chicken dying in some communities in lafia, the state capital and its environs. It was gathered that some areas such as Awgan Nungu, Tudun Amba, Akurba and Gidigidi were the worse hit by the scourge with rising cases of chickens or fowls dying daily. A business woman in Lafia, Mercy Angbas told our correspondent how she lost over 10 chickens to the disease in the last few days. Also, a resident of Agwan Nungu, who simply identified himself as Ahmadu, said many of his chickens had died as a result of bird flu. They, however, appealed to the state government to conduct full investigation into the disease with a view to finding solution to it in order to avoid its spread. When contacted, a senior civil servant in the state Ministry of Agriculture, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told New Telegraph that there were pockets of cases of bird flu, but was quick to add that such cases were not officially reported to the government
