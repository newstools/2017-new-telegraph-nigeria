Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has warned foreigners doing business in Nigeria against sharp practices which could undermine the nation’s economy and self-reliance agenda. Obasanjo, who spoke in Abeokuta at an interactive session with members of the Indian Professionals’ Forum weekend, asked expatriates and foreign investors to desist from alleged importation of fake and substandard products into the country. According to him, it was uncharitable for foreign nationals to engage in sharp practices which they would never venture into in their own countries. The former president noted that foreigners should always engage in mutually beneficial dealings with their host country. He, therefore, enjoined the Indian professionals to always monitor the activities of their nationals and ensure they follow due process in all undertakings. “I was in India and I saw what India is doing for selfreliance, which I admire and I don’t see why any Indian company should come here and undermine our own self-reliance,” Obasanjo noted. The former president, who recalled his experience with Indian expatriates, sought improved trade and economic relations between them and Nigeria. Obasanjo said, “India has tremendous impact on Nigeria becoming independent. The independence of India did not lose its impact on Africa in general but Nigeria in particular. My policies in government as military head of state or military chief executive was substantially influenced by my experience in India.
