Delta State government yesterday said no community in the state was marginalised in the scheme of things in the state. Speaking through the state Information Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Ukah, the government said the alleged marginalisation of a section of the state was only in the imagination of some people and that such people with such impression can be pardoned. The commissioner spoke during an interactive session with a team of journalists during an interview in Asaba. Ukah said Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who he described as a pan-Delta personality, had made sure that every part of the three senatorial districts was not left out of its project implementation, noting however that it was not possible to cover all parts of the state the same time. In the first year of the Okowa administration, no fewer than 47 road projects were awarded and 22 of them had been commissioned. This year, the state had moved up in terms of road construction and soon more roads will be commissioned in all the senatorial districts, he said. The commissioner noted that a few weeks ago, the governor was at Kwale to monitor four ongoing internal road projects. In Beneku, there was another ongoing road project while Ndemili and Nsukwa axis were not left out. This was apart from the building of a model school in Ashaka. On lasting peace in the state, Ukah said the governor, being a man with wisdom, had set up different committees that went round the state interfacing with critical stakeholders and even liaising with the Federal Government, which also culminated in the fruitful visit of the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo early in the year.
