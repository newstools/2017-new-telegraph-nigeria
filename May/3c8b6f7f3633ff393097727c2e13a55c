A political group, Nzuko Umunna, yesterday called for the release of those detained with Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who regained his freedom at the weekend. Chidiebere Onwudiwe, Benjamin Madubugwu and David Nwawusi, had been in detention in Kuje Prison with the IPOB leader since they were detained about two years ago. The group, which expressed happiness at the perfection of the bail condition granted the IPOD leader, regretted that the three other Biafra agitators had not been released despite the previous bail granted them by the court. In a statement issued in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, by the group’s Secretary, Paschal Mbanefo and Coordinator, Ngozi Odumko, Nzuko Umunna called on the Federal Government to look into the numerous issues that gave rise to the unprecedented upsurge of agitations in the South-East. The group warned against use of brutal force to suppress peaceful protest by Biafra agitators. “With great sense of responsibility, Nzuko Umunna joins other wellmeaning Nigerians to welcome the smooth perfection of the bail granted the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, irrespective of the stringent bail conditions that had been questioned by many Nigerians and some of which have the semblance of infringement of fundamental human rights of Kanu.
