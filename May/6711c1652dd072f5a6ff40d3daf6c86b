The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has called on the Federal Government to immediately release all its detained leaders and others allegedly abducted from the Niger Delta in the name of war against Niger Delta Avengers. The group in a statement by its Director of Information, Emma Powerful, said their release was the only panacea for peace to reign in the country. IPOB said the release of its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, should not be a distraction to its resolve to remain focused on fighting for the freedom of other members in custody. The statement reads: “At IPOB, we do not abandon our own. Bright Chimezie Ishinwa, Benjamin Madubugwu, David Nwawuisi, Chidiebere Onwudiwe and others, including those abducted from Niger Delta in the name of war against Niger Delta Avengers, must be released. “We are not unmindful of the positive role played by some individuals at various stages of the process to release our leader. On this note, we wish to commend some South East and South South political leaders, especially those that exhibited rare courage to openly identify with the plight of our leader and the need to free him from detention. Of worthy mention are the likes of Senator Ike Ekweremadu, Senator Enyinaya Abaribe, Prof. Nwala of Ala-Igbo Foundation, the very fearless Osita Chidoka, Tochukwu Uchendu, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, Pat Utomi, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), Igbo Women Assembly(IWA), Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and the Uchenna Madu led MASSOB. We also acknowledged the immense contributions of Femi Fani-Kayode and the Honorary Biafran Gov. Ayodele Fayose who did what no South East or South South governor had the courage to do.
