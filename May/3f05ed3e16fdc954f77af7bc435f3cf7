Oluwo of Iwo land, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, Telu I, yesterday stripped Chief Abiola Ogundokun of all traditional titles conferred on him by the Iwo land Traditional Council. The royal father announced the withdrawal of the traditional titles after a meeting with his traditional chiefs in his palace. He said, “As the ruler and custodian of all traditional, cultural, religious and social clubs in Iwo land, I hereby relieve him of all his traditional and social titles ranging from Basorun Musulumi of Iwoland, member of Iwo Board of Trustees (IBOT), Otun Balogun of Iwoland and other proposed titles that may be accorded to him from Iwo.” But, in his prompt reaction yesterday, Ogundokun said the monarch has no power to strip him of the titles, adding that he is incompetent to do so. According to Ogundokun, there was a board of trustee put in place to appoint him, and that the Oluwo has no power to do anything without taken the proper step. However, the royal father maintained that, “a chief is appointed to favour the town. Any chief, either traditional or religious, who engages in treasonable conduct, should be dealt with accordingly. Ogundokun is one of them. I removed him after due consultation with chiefs, religious leaders, stakeholders and opinion leaders in the interest of Iwo. “He went as far as a radio station to molest Iwo, the crown and her subjects. It is high time we shoved him off. He is a liability to our land. “The Oluwo of Iwoland admitted him to redeem him but later discovered he is an unrepentant and irredeemable being. He has no respect for Iwo and need to be treated like a traitor,” Oluwo stated. According to him, Ogundokun was previously relieved of his titles by the penultimate Oluwo of Iwo, the Late Oba Abimbola. “The recent inclusion was for re-enactment by the paramount ruler of Iwoland. “God created many prophets before He cast out Satan. Ogundokun is the evil that must be cast out,” he added.
