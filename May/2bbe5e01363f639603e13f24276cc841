An Infectious and Tropical Diseases Physician from Bayero University, Kano (BUK), Prof. Abdulrazaq Garba Habib has called for the institutionalisation of a platform for dissemination, translation and policy formulation and practice changes in the country. The platform, according to him, will also disseminate information on public health intervention and implementation of medical education and research. This was part of the thrust of his inaugural lecture delivered at the institution’s Musa Abdullahi Auditorium at the New Campus. According to him “where applicable, research findings should be translated to an entrepreneurial platform. In the same vein, approaches in medicine and sciences should be used to address these societal health challenges to eventually lead to common public good.” In the lecture entitled: “Medicine, Science and Society: The Global Health Imperative,” the don stressed the need for authorities to strengthen health system, human resources for health, surveillance systems, health leadership, prevention and public health, as well as to address health inequities. Accordingly, Habib noted that the dangers of physical inactivity, high blood pressure, metabolic diseases, urbanization, air pollution and climate change should be tackled forthwith, if the nation must prosper, especially given the growing population rate in ‘transition’ in many regions.
