The second phase of the National Women Basketball League sponsored by Zenith Bank starts on Monday (today) at the Ramat Square, Kaduna A total of 18 teams that competed at the first phase in Abuja are also expected to vie for honours in Kaduna with over 200 dunkers on parade. This time however, the last six of the 18 teams will not continue the journey to the next phase in Asaba and so fireworks are expected in this stage of the competition. The Nigeria Basketball Federation, Tijani Umar, has said all is set for the Kaduna phase in which the top teams like First bank, Customs and Dolphins are expected to play against one another this time. Umar said he was elated that Zenith Bank had continued to make the league a big event every year. He said: “It is a thing of joy to me that the partnership struck between the NBBF and Zenith Bank is helping the development of our female players. “Every year, we see more players, more new faces and they are all doing well. That is why we are already thinking of enlarging the scope in the future. The process is on already and so the Kaduna phase will be keenly contested.”
