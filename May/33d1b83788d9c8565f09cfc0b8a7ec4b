Members of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in Ondo State owned Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko (AAUA), were yesterday sharply divided over the petition written against the Vice- Chancellor of the institution to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, by the Chairman of the local branch of ASUU, Dr. Sola Fayose. Fayose, in a petition against the Vice Chancellor, Prof Igbekele Ajibefun, raised some administrative allegations calling for his sack and the setting up of a visitation panel for the university. But several members of ASUU at the weekend insisted there was no congress where such a decision was taken, and thus maintained that the AAUA-ASUU chairman did not have the mandate of members to write such a petition.
