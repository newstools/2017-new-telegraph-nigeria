Space scientists from the University of Leiden, Netherlands under the auspices of the European Union are creating awareness on the importance of space science. This is incorporated with competition. According to Dr.Kingsley Okpala, Dept of Physics & Astronomy, University of Nigeria , Nsukka being the coordinator of the programme in Nigeria; “space awareness is an international project offering a range of tools and activities to inspire children, teenagers, and teachers with space sciences.
The project uses the excitement of space to raise their interest into science and technology and stimulate their sense of global citizenship. Space Awareness offers resources for children, teenagers, science and non-science teachers, science educators and families”.
On the activities of the awareness, Dr.Okpala stated; The project works closely with the European Space Agency and collaborates with many countries outside Europe, in addition to extensive European networks of schools and science museums to reach teachers, educators, students, and the general public.
“The awareness activities include professional development tools, educational resources, citizen science and games, as well as space careers stories. Space Scoop brings you the latest astronomy news from across the Universe each week. Space Awareness website contains information about the project, educational resources and a careers hub”.
On the method of the competition Okpala highlighted; “Individual, groups and/or organisations are invited to submit entries. The entries must be based on using Space Awareness resources. In addition, they must relate to educational activities (whether formal or informal) involving young people i.e. school-age.
