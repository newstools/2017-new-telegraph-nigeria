Stories Stanley Chibuihem Amalaha Eggheads from different Nigerian universities under the umbrella titled: Physics writers Series Creation, have produced array of textbooks in physics for Nigerian students. According to Prof. P.N. Okeke, a world renowned Physicist and president of the association, who initiated the project: “Physics Writers Series Creation is a compendium of seasoned physics lecturers from 20 universities in the South East and South South Nigeria. These lecturers decided to collaborate in the writing and production of different physics textbooks for Nigerian students. The aim is to make physics books easily accessible to our students and to reduce high cost of importation of foreign physics textbooks. It also serves as an academic training for physics lecturers in Nigerian universities because we use local examples in our environment as example in the illustrations in the book for more comprehension for students.
Prof. Okeke further highlighted on the books.
“Some of the textbooks we have produced include; Practical Physics texts; Mechanics/Properties of Matter/Thermal Physics; Electromagnetism/ Modern Physics/ Waves & Optics. These three books cover the syllabus for first year science/engineering courses in Nigerian universities which will help to equip our students in their fields of endevour. Other textbooks we have successfully produced for physics Majors includes: Introduction to Space Science, Special theory of relativity etc.
Prof. P.N. Okeke is a Professor Emeritus of physics & astronomy. He is the best author of physics textbook in West Africa who makes Physics easy and enjoyable in both secondary and tertiary levels.
He is the first African author of astronomy and space science textbooks. The first Director of NASRDA Centre for Basic Science in Nigeria. The first president of African Astronomical Society. He is a world figure with many international collaborations and discoveries.
